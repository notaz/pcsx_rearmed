PCSX-ReARMed - yet another PCSX fork, ARM special

http://notaz.gp2x.de/pcsx_rearmed.php


About
-----

PCSX ReARMed is yet another PCSX fork based on the PCSX-Reloaded project,
which itself contains code from PCSX, PCSX-df and PCSX-Revolution. This
version is ARM architecture oriented and features MIPS->ARM recompiler by
Ari64, NEON GTE code and more performance improvements. It was created for
Pandora handheld, but should be usable on other devices after some code
adjustments (N900, GPH Wiz/Caanoo, PlayBook versions are also available).

PCSX ReARMed features ARM NEON GPU by Exophase, that in many cases produces
pixel perfect graphics at very high performance. There is also Una-i's GPU
plugin from PCSX4ALL project, and traditional P.E.Op.S. one.


Compiling
---------

For libretro build, just doing "make -f Makefile.libretro" is recommended as
it's the way libretro team is building the core and only Makefile.libretro is
maintained by them.

For standalone build, './configure && make' should work for the most part.

When compiling for ARM, it's advisable to tell configure script the CPU, FPU
and ABI that matches your target system to get best performance, like this:

CFLAGS='-mcpu=cortex-a8 -mtune=cortex-a8 -mfpu=neon -mfloat-abi=softfp' ./configure

Cross compilation should also work if kernel-style CROSS_COMPILE variable
is set:
CROSS_COMPILE='arm-none-linux-gnueabi-' ./configure


Usage
-----

There are several different frontends that can be built from source (one
generic and several platform specific), so usage slightly differs depending
on that. Most of them have a menu that can be used to run games and configure
the emulator.

Supported CD image formats:
- .bin/.cue
- .bin/.toc
- .img/.ccd/.sub
- .mdf/.mds
- .Z/.Z.table
- .bz/.bz.table
- .ZNX/.ZNX.table (partial)
- EBOOT.PBP (PSP, partial)
- .cbn

CDDA (CD audio) only supported when .cue/.toc/.ccd/.mds files are present.
There is support for redump.org .sbi files, which can be used instead of
.sub files to save space (name it the same as .cue/.bin, just use .sbi
extension). This is required for Libcrypt copy protected game support.

The emulator can simulate BIOS, which means BIOS files are not required,
however implementation is not complete and some games still need real BIOS
to work. To use real BIOS, copy uncompressed BIOS files to bios/ directory
which itself should be in main emulator directory.

For pandora, it should be:
[sd card]/pandora/appdata/pcsx_rearmed/bios/

When the file is copied, BIOS should be selected in Options->BIOS/Plugins menu.

On pandora, analog controllers are supported using nubs, but this is
disabled by default and needs to be enabled in 'Controls' menu.
There is also touchscreen based GunCon support, which also requires
appropriate controller selected in controls configuration.


Plugins
-------

GPU (graphics) and SPU (sound) plugins can be selected in
[BIOS/Plugins] menu:

builtin_gpu    - this is either Exophase's ARM NEON GPU (accurate and fast,
                 available if platform supports NEON, like on pandora),
                 gpu_peops or gpu_unai (depends on compile options).
gpu_peops.so   - P.E.Op.S. soft GPU, reasonably accurate but slow
                 (also found with older emulators on PC)
gpu_unai.so    - Unai's plugin from PCSX4ALL project. Faster than P.E.Op.S.
                 but has some glitches.
gpu_gles.so    - experimental port of P.E.Op.S. MesaGL plugin to OpenGL ES.
                 Occasionally faster but has lots of glitches and seems to
                 be rather unstable (may crash the driver/system).
builtin_spu    - P.E.Op.S. SPU plugin, optimized for ARM.
spunull.so     - NULL plugin, i.e. no sound emulation.
                 May cause compatibility problems.


Cheats
------

PCSX and cwcheat cheat formats are supported. PCSX .cht file can be loaded from
"extra stuff" menu after game is loaded, while cwcheat cheats are automatically
loaded from cheatpops.db file, if one is present in emulator's directory and
has any cheats for the loaded game in it.
If any of those files are successfully loaded, 'cheats' option will appear in
the main menu where it is possible to enable/disable individual cheats.


Changelog
---------

r22 (2015-02-05)
* general: fixed a race condition/crash in threaded SPU mode
* pandora: C64x: fixed compatibility with newer c64_tools, enabled L2 cache
* frontend: fixed control config corruption on load for devices that are
  disconnected on startup
* some dma accuracy improvements, might fix occasional glitches in ff7
* ARMv6 build and the dynarec now make use of available instructions (gizmo98)

r21 (2015-01-12)
+ general: added ability to run SPU emulation on a separate thread, enabled it
  by default when multicore CPU is detected. Significant effort was made to
  avoid any compatibility problems which the old P.E.Op.S. implementation had.
+ pandora: added ability to run SPU emulation on TI C64x DSP by using bsp's
  c64_tools.
* libretro: fixed win32 build (mingw only)
* some tweaks for the scanline effect and other things

r20 (2014-12-25)
* fixed various sound accuracy issues, like effects in ff7-ff9
  for standalone build, audio will no longer slow down when emu is not fast
  enough and stutter instead, as the former behavior causes accuracy issues.
  Old mode can be restored in SPU plugin config options, but is not recommended.
* savestates now save small parts of dynarec state to reduce dynarec related
  slowdowns after savestate load

* standalone: added some basic scanline efect
* some CD image loading fixes
* converted asm code to be compatible with more assemblers, like Apple's gas

  iOS and QNX. Makefile.libretro is recommended way to do libretro builds
  (patches from CatalystG, squarepusher, notaz and others, see git).
